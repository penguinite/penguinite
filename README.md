Hi, Iâ€™m @penguinite

## About me

I enjoy programming as a hobby and I am generally interested in anything tech-related (except for blockchains, and overhyped AI)
My favorite language is [nim](//github.com/nim-lang/nim/), but I also enjoy programming in Python, Lua, JavaScript, C# and (very, very rarely) C
I believe I have a moral obligation to create things that empower and liberate others, hence why I work primarily for FOSS.

## Projects

The main project taking up a lot of my time now is [Onbox](https://github.com/penguinite/onbox) although I take some time off every now and then to avoid getting burnt out.

I also sometimes work on my older projects, polish them up a bit and fix any buges if I do happen to find them. 

I have given up entirely on [nimforum-re](https://github.com/penguinite/nimforum-re.git) because I think Onbox will be able to replace it, and at most, a MastoAPI -> Nimforum frontend/client is all that will be needed to bridge the gaps
